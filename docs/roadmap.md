# Roadmap detail

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-29 (implementation audit; parity estimates 2026-10-10) · **Last updated:** 2026-11-04 · **Change:** major (local consolidation, safety boundaries and current qualification evidence) · **Target:** Adobe Premiere Pro 2026 (26.5.2)

Forward-looking plan: milestones with status, the current focus and what's next, with estimates in
Opus 5.5 agent-hours (calibration in [target-app-parity.md](target-app-parity.md#calibration)).
The one-page summary is [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md); the ranked work list is [gaps.md](gaps.md).
`cargo xtask parity` already measures menu/effect/transition presence and placement. Behavioural
fidelity, broader coverage and a CI reference gate remain unfinished ([G7](gaps.md#g7-no-measured-parity-tool-in-ci)).
The percentage and Opus 5.5 estimates are the historical 2026-10-10 assessment, not a new forecast.

2026-10-29 local consolidation puts the native Command Console and the preserved editing workflow
on one main baseline. Worker-failure completion, autosave reporting, identities, bounded input
reads, MCP mutation outcomes and failed-edit/save transactions passed the combined local gate,
native/MCP smoke and benchmark qualification. See [evidence and coverage limits](testing.md#consolidated-main-validation-2026-10-29).

The owner approved an Apple Silicon-only portable FilmCraft AI alpha on 2026-11-05.
The current release work is documented in [Apple Silicon alpha](apple-silicon-alpha.md):

1. Preserve the accepted assistant stability, library and named-assistant autosave results.
   Attended timeout recovery restored voice, working context and editing. Exact conversation
   identity is optional; recovered assistant context and functioning tools are the acceptance target.
2. Resolve the provider-side screenshot-retention requirement separately from the already-qualified
   disk-free FilmCraft capture path, and qualify the latest Desktop reconnect report.
3. Remove developer launch dependencies, include the matching MCP helper, and qualify a relocated,
   private-data-free arm64 app with an isolated profile. Verify signing, dependency closure and
   the update channel before preparing installation notes and the release archive.
4. Playback and export-estimate accuracy follow-ups previously accepted for alpha stay deferred.
   The audio-export concern was withdrawn: measured attenuation matches the intentional gain change.

Windows, Linux, Intel Mac validation and Premiere `.prproj` import remain on hold. Direct API
connections remain disabled and unresolved. The historical inventory below remains reference
material rather than the scope of this release.

The 2026-10-29 attended app + Console demo also established a new user requirement:
[audio delivery and understanding](audio-understanding.md): deliver actual project-clip or timeline
audio to an audio-capable model for useful music, dialogue and mix assessment. Beat detection
describes the current baseline, not the requested scope. Provider input capability must be qualified.
Queued by the owner for the next suitable focused milestone after the active stability and Console
workflow checks. Start with provider/audio-delivery qualification, then a bounded clip/range MCP
tool. Existing crash repairs take precedence. The existing demo and release-stage assessment are
unchanged; see the plan's development scheduling and acceptance requirements.

The initial [file attachments and creative memory presets](console-files-and-style-presets.md)
implementation now supports bounded text/PDF/PNG references and reviewed, reusable chat-derived
styles. Local real-Codex checks verified reference reading, style-guided edits, explicit-request
precedence, fresh-project loading and Undo. Audio listening still requires actual original-audio qualification; project/range references
currently supply metadata only. Low-bandwidth generated speech has reached the signed-in Codex
WebRTC path, but that is not music/mix understanding or high-fidelity delivery acceptance. Direct
API integration remains disabled and unresolved by owner decision. See
[qualification and limits](testing.md#console-references-and-styles-2026-10-29).

## Persistent Reference Library (owner requested 2026-11-03)

Owner authorized the [complete Assistant Library/memory next-build scope](assistant-library-next-build.md)
on 2026-11-05, including [additive assistant updates and recoverable memory compaction](assistant-memory-preservation.md).
The current manual update/autosave paths replace instruction snapshots. The proposed
requirements preserve prior teaching and require explicit conflict resolution/removal;
the requirements are not a claim of implementation. Qualify the entire agreed scope
before the next release build; the installed alpha remains unchanged during development.

Owner explicitly requested implementation on 2026-11-05. A source candidate now provides
local book copies, a versioned passage/term index, bounded search with physical page citations,
background native controls and retrieval through the existing Console reference tool.
Source qualification and packaging completed at `097dda3b`: 4,410 tests passed
(52 skipped), with 49 WASM crates checked. The matching signed demo is ready;
its headless save-copy check passed, and packaging preserved memory and library data.
Twelve sampled citations were independently checked against their physical PDF pages.
Matching C40 native checks subsequently passed library controls, filtered live retrieval from
an original supplied book with a verified physical-page citation, named-assistant autosave,
and full-app restoration of opt-in and reference selections. The owner subsequently accepted
attended timeout recovery with restored context, voice and editing.
The user can import books, editing guides, manuals and personal notes once into a persistent
Reference Library. Save the documents and a reusable passage index across sessions and builds,
so fresh Codex sessions can retrieve relevant material quickly without rereading whole books
or injecting the full library into every conversation.

Acceptance requirements:

- Retain document identity and source metadata, with chapter/page references where available;
  retrieved passages identify the supporting document and location.
- Make the existing index available to fresh sessions; retrieve bounded, relevant excerpts on
  demand and verify relevance and retrieval speed with representative documents.
- Let users select references for a project or saved Project Assistant, separately from project
  memory and creative preferences.
- Adding, replacing or deleting documents updates the index; removed or superseded content must
  not remain retrievable. Preserve the library across builds and qualify migration and recovery.
- Keep imported private reference material local and out of Git/release assets. Make clear which
  excerpts are sent to the connected AI. Malformed files, indexing failures and low disk must
  report actionable errors without crashing or damaging projects or the existing library.

The owner moved this milestone into implementation. Shared-library enable/remove controls are
present in the signed package. C40 adds project/assistant reference subsets, filtered retrieval
and stale-result guards; its full gate and matching native controls/persistence checks passed.
Private books stay in the preserved data profile on D, outside Git and release assets.

### Queued: on-demand reference page images (owner approved 2026-11-05)

Implementation authorized within the complete next-build scope; rendering is not implemented yet.
Owner-selected UI name: **Assistant Library**. Add **Window → Assistant Library**
to open it independently of Command Console; retain the Console shortcut and use
the same name there. This is one shared library, not a second copy of its data.
Search should return text with stable document identity and physical PDF page references.
When the connected AI needs an illustration or layout, it can explicitly request that
specific admitted document/page through FilmCraft MCP. Render only requested pages;
do not prerender the library or send entire books automatically. Deliver the actual image
with its document/page citation, bounded dimensions, encoded bytes, concurrency and time.
Use in-memory delivery with no retained temporary capture files, and release temporary
buffers after delivery or failure. Provider-side conversation retention is separate and
must not be described as deleted by FilmCraft. Reject removed documents, stale selections,
invalid pages and unavailable rendering with actionable errors; never claim unseen content.
Qualify actual image delivery and interpretation with representative illustrated books.
OCR for searchable scanned books, strict-parser compatibility, and larger library capacity
are separate follow-ups to scope and qualify before another release build.

## Current focus

In order. Each item links to its gap entry, which says what "done" means.

1. **Stop launch crashes and verify pull-request CI** ([G4](gaps.md#g4-launch-crashes-and-cross-platform-pr-ci)): confirm `cargo xtask ci` on macOS, Windows and Linux for every PR; old-macOS and Intel-GPU start-up. 40–80 h.
2. **Open `.prproj`** ([G2](gaps.md#g2-premieres-prproj-cannot-be-opened)): the beta blocker. 60–120 h.
3. **10-bit / 4:2:2 camera media in software** ([G3](gaps.md#g3-10-bit-and-422-camera-media-needs-hardware)). 30–50 h.
4. **Fidelity harness against Premiere** ([G1](gaps.md#g1-nothing-compares-our-output-with-premieres)) and **`cargo xtask parity`** ([G7](gaps.md#g7-no-measured-parity-tool-in-ci)): turns estimates into measurements. 50–90 h.
5. **Real-world media corpus and workflow tests** ([G6](gaps.md#g6-no-real-world-media-corpus-or-workflow-acceptance-tests)). 40–70 h.
6. **Hardware acceleration, continued** (#30, [G5](gaps.md#g5-hardware-acceleration-is-partial)): zero-copy upload, Lumetri curves / wheels / HSL and keys on the GPU, VideoToolbox Main 10, Quick Sync / AMF encoders. 120–200 h.
7. **UI fidelity issues** ([G8](gaps.md#g8-ui-fidelity-monitor-handles-effect-controls-docking)): Program monitor transform handles, Effect Controls, docking. 120–200 h.

## Alpha gate

Premiere's core daily workflows, checked end to end on the main platform (macOS, Apple silicon),
including saving the work as `.fcproj` and reopening it (atomic saves, schema migrations,
auto-save and crash recovery; migration tests). Strict reading: a "partial" that stops the
workflow would make FilmCraft pre-alpha.

| Workflow | Works end to end? | Evidence | Hours to pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ingest and organize media (import camera / phone / screen files, bins, metadata, proxies) | partial, not blocking | H.264 / HEVC / ProRes / DNx / MXF / AVCHD / MKV import with bit-exact decoders, Media Browser, bins, proxies, Link Media. Gaps: H.264 10-bit / 4:2:2 (Sony XAVC S-I, Canon XF-AVC) opens nowhere and HEVC 4:2:2 only through VideoToolbox (#626, [G3](gaps.md#g3-10-bit-and-422-camera-media-needs-hardware)); E-AC-3 (#647), AVI (#598), camera RAW | 0 (G3 is a beta item, 30–50 h) |
| Assemble and trim a sequence (insert / overwrite, ripple / roll / slip / slide, razor, J/K/L, multicam) | yes | Edit algebra with undo tests, Trim Monitor, Premiere keyboard preset, multicam with audio sync; UX issues (#683, #648, #668) slow it down but don't stop it | 0 |
| Colour correct and grade (Lumetri, LUTs, scopes, colour management) | yes | Lumetri complete with CPU / WGSL parity tests, all Lumetri Scopes, LUT import, HDR export signalling checked with ffprobe | 0 |
| Mix audio (levels, automation, Essential Sound, loudness) | yes on macOS | Mixer graph, automation, 53 effects, BS.1770 loudness matching ffmpeg; device reports are Windows / Linux (#605, #617) | 0 |
| Titles and captions | yes | Text engine, graphic clips, templates, SRT / VTT / SCC / MCC / STL / TTML import-export, burn-in; Arabic titles broken (#395) | 0 |
| Deliver (export H.264 / HEVC / ProRes / DNxHR / MXF with presets, queue) | yes | Own H.264 + AAC encoder, ProRes, DNxHR, MXF, hardware HEVC on macOS, ffprobe-checked exports; bitrate target miss (#371) | 0 |

**Passes:** every core workflow runs end to end on macOS and the project saves and reopens, so
FilmCraft stays **alpha**; the one partial (10-bit / 4:2:2 camera codecs) blocks some cameras'
originals, not the workflow, and is on the beta list. Interchange with Premiere's own `.prproj`
is a beta requirement, not an alpha one (sequences come over as FCP7 XML, AAF or OTIO).

## Beta milestones

Beta = ready for real work ≥ ~75% and `.prproj` opens reliably ([target-app-parity.md](target-app-parity.md#stage)).
